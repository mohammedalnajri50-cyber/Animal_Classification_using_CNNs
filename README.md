# 🐾 Animal Classification using CNNs

Deep Learning project for classifying animal images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify animal images.  
It includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Visualization of sample data  
- CNN model creation and training  
- Evaluation with accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix and classification report  
- Inference on new unseen images
